# Implementation Status — live progress tracker

**Read this first on every resume.** It records what is done, what is next, key decisions, and the test inventory. Update it in the same commit as any code change.

Roadmap source: the Si + nonlocal-super-compute task (Parts A–F) plus future crystals/effects. The maintainer drives one bounded increment per session ("continue"). Test grid: **4×4×4 (or 5×5×5), scalar (no spinor)**.

## Status by part

| Part | Item | State | Branch / PR | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| pre | CF4/Yoshida/Strang propagator, Kuhn-Zurek dephasing, frozen core | ✅ | merged | do NOT touch the integrator |

| pre | Coulomb TDHF exchange Σ^HF (Golde-Kira-Meier-Koch) | ✅ | merged (#41/#43) | non-k-local, all-gather/step; δρ subtraction; Hermitian |
| pre | EPM GaAs + 4-fold FCC folding + unfold pipeline | ✅ | merged | `epm_gaas_reference.py`, `SYSNAME_unfold.data` |

## Decisions log (gotchas that bit us / must not be re-litigated)
- **Si gap:** a 3-parameter local EPM gives ~1.06 eV converged = Kunikiyo's own calc (1.068), NOT the 1.12 eV experimental value. The spec's "30 meV from 1.12" is against experiment; treat **1.068 eV (Kunikiyo calc)** as the real target. CBM at 0.86·2π/a along ⟨100⟩.
- **Si diamond:** V^A ≡ 0 for all shells → the existing zincblende `VS·cos + i·VA·sin` machinery is reused verbatim with V^A=0 (purely real diamond). τ=(a/8)(1,1,1) for both.
- **Coulomb Σ^HF uses δρ = ρ − ρ₀** (ρ₀ = diag(occup)) so Σ(t=0)=0 and the equilibrium EPM gap is unchanged. Verified Hermitian; 1-rank vs 2-rank populations bitwise-identical.
- **nex density** = (excited e per cell)/V_cell; the /N_k is already in `calc_trace` via /Σ(kweight) (BZ average). Do NOT divide by N_k again.
- **Max ionization ceiling** (32 e per cubic cell) = 1.77e23 cm⁻³ (full valence inversion).
- **GitHub CI is serial-only by request** (compiler/syntax gate). MPI verified locally.
- **Commits are signed-off** (`git commit -s`), trailers Co-Authored-By + Claude-Session.

## CPTP invariants (must hold for every new dissipator)
- Each exp(τD) a genuine GKLS map; clamp all (1−ρ) Pauli factors to [0,1].
- Yoshida wraps ONLY the unitary part; dissipator always τ>0.
- Hermitian-only dissipator must conserve populations exactly (Γ_aa=0).

## Test inventory (`tests/`)
| Test | Covers | How |
|---|---|---|
| `test_si_epm_gap.py` | Part A | primitive sublattice-block Si gap ≈1.06 eV, CBM≈0.86·2π/a |
| `test_ii_form_switch.py` | Part B | rate γ=P(ε−E_th)^a scaling for a=2 vs 4 |
| _(add per increment)_ | | |

Run all: `python3 tests/run_all.py` (each test prints PASS/FAIL and exits nonzero on failure).

## Next action on resume
**Implement Part E** (HF sublattice-block projection): add `yn_sbe_hf_sublattice_proj` (default 'y' when HF on in a folded cubic cell); in `compute_coulomb_selfenergy`, after forming Σ^HF(k), zero the inter-sublattice matrix elements using the unfold weights `gs%unfold_w` (keep intra-sublattice). Validate: weak-field run shows no spurious Γ→X/Γ→L transfer attributable to exchange; unit test that inter-sublattice Σ elements vanish.
