# Implementation Status — live progress tracker

**Read this first on every resume.** It records what is done, what is next, key decisions, and the test inventory. Update it in the same commit as any code change.

Roadmap source: the Si + nonlocal-super-compute task (Parts A–F) plus future crystals/effects. The maintainer drives one bounded increment per session ("continue"). Test grid: **4×4×4 (or 5×5×5), scalar (no spinor)**.

## Decisions log (gotchas that bit us / must not be re-litigated)
- **Si gap:** a 3-parameter local EPM gives ~1.06 eV converged = Kunikiyo's own calc (1.068), NOT the 1.12 eV experimental value. The spec's "30 meV from 1.12" is against experiment; treat **1.068 eV (Kunikiyo calc)** as the real target. CBM at 0.86·2π/a along ⟨100⟩.
- **Si diamond:** V^A ≡ 0 for all shells → the existing zincblende `VS·cos + i·VA·sin` machinery is reused verbatim with V^A=0 (purely real diamond). τ=(a/8)(1,1,1) for both.
- **Coulomb Σ^HF uses δρ = ρ − ρ₀** (ρ₀ = diag(occup)) so Σ(t=0)=0 and the equilibrium EPM gap is unchanged. Verified Hermitian; 1-rank vs 2-rank populations bitwise-identical.
- **nex density** = (excited e per cell)/V_cell; the /N_k is already in `calc_trace` via /Σ(kweight) (BZ average). Do NOT divide by N_k again.
- **Max ionization ceiling** (32 e per cubic cell) = 1.77e23 cm⁻³ (full valence inversion).
- **GitHub CI is serial-only by request** (compiler/syntax gate). MPI verified locally.
- **Commits are signed-off** (`git commit -s`), trailers Co-Authored-By + Claude-Session.

## CPTP invariants (must hold for every new dissipator)
- Each exp(τD) a genuine GKLS map; clamp all (1−ρ) Pauli factors to [0,1].
- Yoshida wraps ONLY the unitary part; dissipator always τ>0.
- Hermitian-only dissipator must conserve populations exactly (Γ_aa=0).

## Test inventory (`tests/`)
| Test | Covers | How |
|---|---|---|
| `test_si_epm_gap.py` | Part A | primitive sublattice-block Si gap ≈1.06 eV, CBM≈0.86·2π/a |
| `test_ii_form_switch.py` | Part B | rate γ=P(ε−E_th)^a scaling for a=2 vs 4 |
| `test_hf_sublattice_proj.py` | Part E | proj zeroes inter-sublattice, keeps diag, Hermitian; real GaAs weights |
| `test_superres_rates.f90` | Part C primitives | ν(ε) limits, N_B, energy-bin area/peak, Fröhlich asinh, II 2^a scaling, BGR −19/−41 meV, data tables (standalone gfortran) |
| `test_eph_cptp.f90` | Part C5/C6 | amplitude-damping map: trace, qubit positivity (det≥0), transfer formulas, coherence damping, Hermiticity, γ=0 identity |
| `test_superres_rates.f90` (extended) | Part C5 | + unit conversions (meV/eV·cm/eV·Å/g·cm⁻³→a.u.), golden_rule_prefactor, eph_thermal_split (fe+fa=1, fe/fa=(N+1)/N) |
| _(add per increment)_ | | |

End-to-end smoke (manual): scalar GaAs 4³, `yn_sbe_superres='y'` + `yn_sbe_eph='y'`
→ runs stable, correct diagnostics (ħω=36 meV, N_B=0.33 @300 K), trace = 32.000
conserved over all steps (CPTP at the dynamics level).

End-to-end smoke (manual, not in run_all): scalar GaAs 4³, `yn_sbe_coulomb='y'`
+ `yn_sbe_hf_sublattice_proj='y'`, weak field → runs stable, finite, projection
diagnostic confirmed. Full "zero spurious Γ→X transfer" weak-field validation
is a longer run, deferred to a dedicated validation pass.

Run all: `python3 tests/run_all.py` (each test prints PASS/FAIL and exits nonzero on failure).

## Next action on resume
The k-local super-mode feature set is COMPLETE and tested: C0, C-prim, C2, C5
(full phonon table), C6, C7 (BGR threshold), C8 (sub-cycling) all ✅. Every
new channel is CPTP (trace conserved end-to-end) and gated OFF by default.

**Next increment — Part F (e-e architecture TODO hook):** small, no physics.
Add a clearly-marked TODO + design comment for the e-e density-fluctuation
channel (L_q = Σ_k c†_{k+q} c_k, screened-Coulomb rates, O(N_k²) double-q sum,
mean-field (1−ρ) closure, Thomas-Fermi→Lindhard screening) sited so it slots
into the ring pass alongside Σ^HF + nonlocal II without redesign. Leave a
named accumulator-slot hook in the (future) ring data structures. Phase-2, no
coefficients. [Taj-Rossi PRA 78, 052113; Rosati et al. PRB 90, 125140]

**Then the final major effort — nonlocal (C4) + ring MPI (D):**
- C3 full energy-windowed expanding-radius partner search (enumeration, no MC).
- C4 nonlocal momentum-exchange impact ionization + nonlocal e-ph (genuine q).
- D systolic-ring MPI replacing the all-gather; ONE fused ring pass for Σ^HF +
  nonlocal II + nonlocal e-ph (+ the F e-e hook); active-subspace compression;
  C1 predictor-corrector.
Validate against the Chefonov Si THz-bleaching staging (wiki/04 Example 4)
before claiming physical correctness. Keep all behind yn_sbe_superres OFF.

Also pending (validation, not code): a longer Si super-mode run to check the
e-ph cooling actually reduces the Drude conductivity (bleaching) -- needs a Si
dataset (epm_material='Si', scalar) and the carrier-density/current diagnostics.
